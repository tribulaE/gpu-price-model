<!-- GPU PRICE MODEL -->

Progess 1
- Project structure set up
- GPU dataset stored in `data/gpus.csv`
- Basic data-loading script in `src/train.py`

Progess 2 
- GPU name converted to machine-readable features using on hot encoding
- Train test split implemented

Progess 3
- Trained a RandomForest model and printed metrics using R2 and MAE 
- Feed the function back into the main function 

Progess 4
- Comparing predictions vs the actual price of a GPU
- Used the for loop and zip to loop through both lists of true_price and pred_price at the same time
